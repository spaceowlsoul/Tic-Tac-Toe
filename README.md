Tic-Tac-Toe

You know the rules :) 
This game is counted on two players.
X-s go first. The player chooses the coordinates of his move this way: 'row, column' separated with empty space.
Then O-s go, then X again, etc.
The goal is to be the first to have made a sequence of three X or O in a row, column, or diagonal.
If there are no sequences and no empty cell left, no one is the winner and it's the draw!
Good luck!:)
